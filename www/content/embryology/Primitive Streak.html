<h1>Primitive Streak</h1><ul><li>Near the caudal end of the bilaminar embryo, a liner thickening of the epiblast commences and proceeds cranially. This linear thickening of the epiblast is termed the primitive streak.</li><li>The cranial end of the primitive streak is bulbous and is called as the Primitive node or the Hensen’s node. Subsequently the primitive node develops a pit and is called as the primitive pit. </li><li>Cells of the primitive streak become flask shaped, detach from the epiblast and slip underneath it. This inward movement of epiblast cells is called invagination. Cell migration and invagination are controlled by Fibroblast growth factor 8 (FG8) which is synthesised by the streak cells themselves.</li><li>Once the cells have invaginated, some displace the hypoblast creating the embryonic endoderm. Other cells come to lie between the endoderm and the epiblast to form the mesoderm.</li><li>The cells remaining in the epiblast form the ectoderm.</li><li>Thus, the epiblast forms the primitive streak. The primitive streak, through a process of gastrulation, forms all the three germ layers. The germ layers are the source of all tissues and organs in the embryo. </li></ul><h2>Clinical relevance</h2><p>Heterotaxy Syndromes:<strong> </strong>Asymmetry failure (nodal/FGF8 defects) → situs inversus</p><p>Sacrococcygeal Teratoma: Persistent streak remnants (germ cell mis-migration) → tumors</p><p>Spina Bifida: Incomplete streak regression disrupts notochord → NTDs</p><p>Teratogen Exposure: Retinoic acid excess inhibits FGF8 → caudal agenesis</p>
